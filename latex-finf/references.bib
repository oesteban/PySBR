In this work, technetium-99methylcysteinatedimer ({99mTc-ECD)} {SPECT} data sets of 28 {AD} patients and 28 asymptomatic controls were used for the analysis. For a series of different data preprocessing methods, which includes methods for spatial normalization, smoothing, and intensity normalization, multivariate image analysis based on principal component analysis ({PCA)} and Fisher discriminant analysis ({FDA)} was applied. Bootstrap resampling was used to investigate the robustness of the analysis and the classification accuracy, depending on the data preprocessing method. Depending on the combination of preprocessing methods, significant differences regarding the classification accuracy were observed. For {99mTc-ECD} {SPECT} data, the optimal data preprocessing method in terms of robustness and classification accuracy is based on affine registration, smoothing with a Gaussian of 12 mm full width half maximum, and intensity normalization based on the 25\% brightest voxels within the whole-brain region.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} To design a novel algorithm ({BasGan)} for automatic segmentation of striatal ({123)I-FP-CIT} {SPECT.}
{METHODS:} The {BasGan} algorithm is based on a high-definition, three-dimensional ({3D)} striatal template, derived from Talairach's atlas. A blurred template, obtained by convolving the former with a {3D} Gaussian kernel ({FWHM} = 10 mm), approximates striatal activity distribution. The algorithm performs translations and scale transformation on the bicommissural aligned image to set the striatal templates with standard size in an appropriate initial position. An optimization protocol automatically performs fine adjustments in the positioning of blurred templates to best match the radioactive counts, and locates an occipital {ROI} for background evaluation. Partial volume effect correction is included in the process of uptake computation of caudate, putamen and background. Experimental validation was carried out by means of six acquisitions of an anthropomorphic striatal phantom. The {BasGan} software was applied to a first set of patients with Parkinson's disease ({PD)} versus patients affected by essential tremor.
{RESULTS:} A highly significant correlation was achieved between true binding potential and measured ({123)I} activity from the phantom. ({123)I-FP-CIT} uptake was significantly lower in all basal ganglia in the {PD} group versus controls with both {BasGan} and a conventional {ROI} method used for comparison, but particularly with the former. Correlations with the motor {UPDRS} score were far more significant with the {BasGan.}
{CONCLUSION:} The novel {BasGan} algorithm automatically performs the {3D} segmentation of striata. Because co-registered {MRI} is not needed, it can be used by all nuclear medicine departments, since it is freely available on the Web.},

	abstract = {Automatic segmentation of subcortical structures in human brain {MR} images is an important but difficult task due to poor and variable intensity contrast. Clear, well-defined intensity features are absent in many places along typical structure boundaries and so extra information is required to achieve successful segmentation. A method is proposed here that uses manually labelled image data to provide anatomical training information. It utilises the principles of the Active Shape and Appearance Models but places them within a Bayesian framework, allowing probabilistic relationships between shape and intensity to be fully exploited. The model is trained for 15 different subcortical structures using 336 manually-labelled T1-weighted {MR} images. Using the Bayesian approach, conditional probabilities can be calculated easily and efficiently, avoiding technical problems of ill-conditioned covariance matrices, even with weak priors, and eliminating the need for fitting extra empirical scaling parameters, as is required in standard Active Appearance Models. Furthermore, differences in boundary vertex locations provide a direct, purely local measure of geometric change in structure between groups that, unlike voxel-based morphometry, is not dependent on tissue classification methods or arbitrary smoothing. In this paper the fully-automated segmentation method is presented and assessed both quantitatively, using Leave-One-Out testing on the 336 training images, and qualitatively, using an independent clinical dataset involving Alzheimer's disease. Median Dice overlaps between 0.7 and 0.9 are obtained with this method, which is comparable or better than other automated methods. An implementation of this method, called {FIRST}, is currently distributed with the freely-available {FSL} package.},

These algorithms require accurate modelling of the so-called point spread function ({PSF).} Nowadays, most in vivo neurotransmitter {SPECT} studies employ pharmaceuticals radiolabelled with {123I.} In addition to an intense line at 159 {keV}, the decay scheme of this radioisotope includes some higher energy gammas which may have a non-negligible contribution to the {PSF.} The aim of this work is to study this contribution for two low-energy high-resolution collimator configurations, namely, the parallel and the fan beam. The transport of radiation through the material system is simulated with the Monte Carlo code {PENELOPE.} We have developed a main program that deals with the intricacies associated with tracking photon trajectories through the geometry of the collimator and detection systems. The simulated {PSFs} are partly validated with a set of experimental measurements that use the 511 {keV} annihilation photons emitted by a {18F} source. Sensitivity and spatial resolution have been studied, showing that a significant fraction of the detection events in the energy window centred at 159 {keV} (up to approximately 49\% for the parallel collimator) are originated by higher energy gamma rays, which contribute to the spatial profile of the {PSF} mostly outside the 'geometrical' region dominated by the low-energy photons. Therefore, these high-energy counts are to be considered as noise, a fact that should be taken into account when modelling {PSFs} for reconstruction algorithms. We also show that the fan beam collimator gives higher signal-to-noise ratios than the parallel collimator for all the source positions analysed.},

	abstract = {{123I} is a commonly used radioisotope employed in neurotransmitter {SPECT} studies. In addition to an intense line at 159 {keV}, the decay scheme of this radioisotope includes a low yield (\~{}3\%) of higher energy photons which make a non-negligible contribution to the final image when low-energy high-resolution ({LEHR)} collimators are used. This contribution of high-energy photons may reach \~{}28\% of the total counts in the projections. The aim of this work is to model each energy component of the high-energy Point Spread Function ({hPSF)} for fan-beam {LEHR} collimators in order to develop fast Monte Carlo ({MC)} simulations of high-energy ray contamination. The modeling of {hPSF} was based on the results of simulating photons through the collimator-detector system using the {MC} code {PENELOPE.} Since low-energy {PSFs} models for fan-beam collimators tend to a Gaussian distribution, we use the same function for the {hPSF} modeling for high-energy photons. The parameters of these Gaussian functions (g(x,y)) were obtained by minimizing the root mean square error ({RMS)} using the sensitivity of the simulated {hPSFs} as a constraint. The {hPSFs} were parameterized for a range of energies between 350 {keV} and 538 {keV.} The {RMS} attained after fitting of g(x,y) to the simulated {hPSFs} was always smaller than \~{}2\% of the mean sensitivity per pixel of the image. A strong dependence of the sensitivity on the type and thickness of the backscatter material behind the crystal was found. Our results indicate that Gaussian distributions approximate the {hPSF} responses for fan-beam collimators.

The aim of this work was to compare the quantitative capabilities of two different {SPECT} systems through Monte Carlo ({MC)} simulation. The {SimSET} {MC} code was employed to generate simulated projections of a numerical phantom for two gamma cameras equipped with a parallel and a fan-beam collimator, respectively. A fully {3D} iterative reconstruction algorithm was used to compensate for attenuation, the spatially variant point spread function ({PSF)} and scatter. A post-reconstruction partial volume effect ({PVE)} compensation was also developed. For both systems, the correction for all degradations and {PVE} compensation resulted in recovery factors of the theoretical specific uptake ratio ({SUR)} close to 100\%. For a {SUR} value of 4, the recovered {SUR} for the parallel imaging system was 33\% for a reconstruction without corrections ({OSEM)}, 45\% for a reconstruction with attenuation correction ({OSEM-A)}, 56\% for a {3D} reconstruction with attenuation and {PSF} corrections ({OSEM-AP)}, 68\% for {OSEM-AP} with scatter correction ({OSEM-APS)} and 97\% for {OSEM-APS} plus {PVE} compensation ({OSEM-APSV).} For the fan-beam imaging system, the recovered {SUR} was 41\% without corrections, 55\% for {OSEM-A}, 65\% for {OSEM-AP}, 75\% for {OSEM-APS} and 102\% for {OSEM-APSV.} Our findings indicate that the correction for degradations increases the quantification accuracy, with {PVE} compensation playing a major role in the {SUR} quantification. The proposed methodology allows us to reach similar {SUR} values for different {SPECT} systems, thereby allowing a reliable standardisation in multicentric studies.},

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the modern world. Cardiac imaging is routinely applied for assessment and diagnosis of cardiac diseases. Computerized image analysis methods are now widely applied to cardiac segmentation and registration in order to extract the anatomy and contractile function of the heart. The vast number of recent papers on this topic point to the need for an up to date survey in order to summarize and classify the published literature. This paper presents a survey of shape modeling applications to cardiac image analysis from {MRI}, {CT}, echocardiography, {PET}, and {SPECT} and aims to (1) introduce new methodologies in this field, (2) classify major contributions in image-based cardiac modeling, (3) provide a tutorial to beginners to initiate their own studies, and (4) introduce the major challenges of registration and segmentation and provide practical examples. The techniques surveyed include statistical models, deformable models/level sets, biophysical models, and non-rigid registration using basis functions. About 130 journal articles are categorized based on methodology, output, imaging system, modality, and validations. The advantages and disadvantages of the registration and validation techniques are discussed as appropriate in each section.},

	abstract = {One of the most challenging problems in modern neuroimaging is detailed characterization of neurodegeneration. Quantifying spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia ({FTD)} and Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease ({AD)}, which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method ({SyN)} for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the {Euler{\textendash}Lagrange} equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast {SyN{\textquoteright}s} performance with a related elastic method and with the standard {ITK} implementation of Thirion{\textquoteright}s Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of {FTD} and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, {SyN{\textquoteright}s} volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that {SyN}, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric {MRI} of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},

An octree data structure of 3 {\texttimes} 3 {\texttimes} 3 lattice points is built to examine the local connectivity. The sets of "simple" points found by different researchers are compared with the constructed set. Different definitions of "surface" points including ours are given. By preserving the topological and the geometrical conditions, our algorithm produces desirable skeletons and performs better than others in terms of noise sensitivity and speed. Pre- and postprocessors can be used to remove additional noise spurs. Its use in defect analysis of objects produced by casting and forging is discussed.},

Statistical parametric mapping ({SPM)} is a fully automated voxel-based statistical approach that has great potential in the context of {DAT} imaging. However, the accuracy of the spatial normalization provided by {SPM} has not been validated for {123I-FP-CIT} images. Our first aim was to create an {123I-FP-CIT} template that does not require the acquisition of patient-specific {MRI} and to validate the spatial normalization procedure. Next, we hypothesized that this customized template could be used by different {SPECT} centers without affecting the outcomes of imaging analyses. Methods: The spatial normalization to the customized template created with {SPM} (template A1) was validated using {123I-FP-CIT} images obtained from 6 subjects with essential tremor ({ET)} with normal {DAT} status and 6 {PD} patients. Variability in {BR} values due to the normalization was evaluated using striatal volume of interest ({VOI).} To determine whether different {SPECT} centers could use a unique {123I-FP-CIT} template, we generated 3 other {123I-FP-CIT} templates using different subjects and image-processing schemes. The interchangeability of these templates was assessed using (a) putamen {BR} values analyzed with the intraclass correlation coefficient ({ICC)} and the {Bland{\textendash}Altman} graphical analysis, and (b) {SPM} analysis comparing the results of group comparisons{\textemdash}that is, {ET} versus {PD}, obtained after normalization to each of the 4 templates. Results: There was no significant difference between pre- and postnormalization striatal {BR} values in our study. The mean variability calculated with putamen {VOI} values after normalization to each template was {\textless}10\%, with the lowest {ICC} of 98\%. Intergroup analyses performed with {VOI} and {SPM} approaches provided similar results independently of the template used. Conclusion: {SPM} normalization was accurate even in subjects with low striatal {123I-FP-CIT} uptake, making it a promising approach for automatic analysis of {123I-FP-CIT} images using a single customized template at different centers.},

	abstract = {Phantom experiments and simulations were performed to evaluate the significance of different error sources in a clinical registration procedure for brain {SPET} and {MRI} based on external markers. The results from the phantom experiments were used to adjust the error model for simulations. In the phantom experiments, 13-14 external markers were attached to the surface of a three-dimensional brain phantom for computing registration. Three internal test markers were used to estimate the accuracy of registration. The phantom was imaged with two different {SPET} and {MRI} devices. The mean root-mean-squared ({RMS)} residual of the locations of the test markers after registration using different combinations of four external markers varied from 3.5 +/- 1.0 to 5.2 +/- 1.3 mm depending on the imaging equipment and parameters used. The accuracy improved with an increasing number of external markers, from 3.2 +/- 0.5 to 4.9 +/- 0.5 mm for 6 markers and from 3.1 +/- 0.1 to 4.7 +/- 0.1 mm for 13 markers. In simulations, the external markers had an error comparable to the corresponding error in the phantom experiments. The error in the test markers was varied independently of that of the external markers. When the locating error of the test markers was removed, about 2 mm of the residuals of the test markers were found to come from this source. When an error comparable to the resolution of the original images (7-10 mm for {SPET}, 2 mm for {MRI)} was included in the test markers, the largest mean {RMS} residual after registration was smaller than the resolution error (8.8 +/- 1.1 mm). This was due to the accuracy of localization of the external markers and the fact that the direction of the error was random for each marker. The size of the registration error of an image volume was site-dependent, being minimal near the centre of mass of the external markers. When comparing the error with the spatial resolution of {SPET}, it was concluded that the accuracy of registration is not the limiting factor in region-of-interest analysis of registered images, provided that the design and attachment of the marker system are appropriate.},

	abstract = {A lack of standardized evaluation procedures for dopamine transporter ({DAT)} {SPECT} investigations impairs both intra- and interindividual comparisons as well as multicenter trials{\textemdash}for example, for assessment of disease progression or the response to various drug treatments. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate a novel automated method, which has been specifically developed for a standardized quantification of N-(3-fluoropropyl)-2$\beta$-carbomethoxy-3$\beta$-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane ({123I-FP-CIT)} {SPECT} studies. Methods: {DAT} binding ratios of 155 {123I-FP-CIT} {SPECT} studies in 14 control subjects and 141 patients referred to confirm or exclude a presynaptic dopaminergic deficit were determined manually and by a fully automated technique. The latter included coregistration of patient studies to an {123I-FP-CIT} mean template of controls with specialized, nonrigid adjustment for variation in striatal location, followed by calculation of specific striatal {DAT} binding using a standardized 3-dimensional volume-of-interest ({VOI)} map. The map is based on a {MR} scan and covers the striatum (S), caudate (C), putamen (P), and an occipital reference region. The semiquantitative ratios of both methods were compared with the visual findings. Results: Excellent linear correlations were observed between manually and automatically determined results (S: r = 0.99; C: r = 0.99; P: r = 0.99; P {\textless} 0.001, respectively). Automated evaluations delivered highly reproducible and visually exact coregistrations. Individual variations in striatal anatomy (e.g., atrophy) were considered and {VOI} positions were corrected before quantification. Both the manual and the automated method showed identical accuracy in supporting the visual diagnoses. Conclusion: In a large patient population, excellent agreement was observed between quantitative {DAT} results using a time-consuming, observer-dependent, conventional manual method and the objective, automated evaluation specifically developed for a standardized evaluation of {123I-FP-CIT} {SPECT} studies. It is suggested that the novel automated technique may substantially facilitate both intra- and interindividual comparisons as well as multicenter trials.},

The aim of this work was to evaluate the software linearity and its dependence on the main acquisition parameters of the {SPECT} study. Methods: The anthropomorphic Striatal Phantom filled with different striatal to background activity concentration ratios was used to verify software linearity. The software response was studied with different acquisition parameters and system configurations. For this purpose, phantom studies were performed with varying radius of rotation, pixel size, number of projections and with different collimator types. For each configuration the tomographic spatial resolution was also determined using the Triple Line Source Phantom. The reconstructed {SPECT} images were corrected for attenuation and scatter. Results: The {BasGan} outcome highly correlates with the real Specific Binding Ratio when fixed gamma camera configuration and reconstruction method are used. However, the software quantification depends on system configuration and decreases with increasing partial volume effect. A comparison of the {BasGan} output with tomographic spatial resolution data for each configuration shows that the software response highly correlates with this quantity. Conclusion: The {BasGan} algorithm is a free, easy-to-use and solid tool for quantification of [{123I]FP-CIT} images. The software outcome depends on system configuration, but highly correlates with tomographic spatial resolution. Then, the measurement of this quantity turns out to be a simple method to normalize the {BasGan} quantification for different imaging devices, making it possible the use of available reference values for normal subjects and multicentre studies.},

	abstract = {To test whether the use of a striatum weighted image may improve registration accuracy and diagnostic outcome in patients with parkinsonian syndromes ({PS)}, weighted images were generated by increasing signal intensity of striatal voxels and used as intermediate dataset for co-registering the brain image onto template. Experimental validation was performed using an anthropomorphic striatal phantom. {123I-FP-CIT} {SPECT} binding ratios were manually determined in 67 {PS} subjects and compared to those obtained using unsupervised standard ({UWR)} and weighted registered ({WR)} approach. Normalized cost function was used to evaluate the accuracy of phantom and subjects registered images to the template. Reproducibility between unsupervised and manual ratios was assessed by using intra-class correlation coefficient ({ICC)} and Bland and Altman analysis. Correlation coefficient was used to assess the dependence of semi-quantitative ratios on clinical findings. Weighted method improves accuracy of brain registration onto template as determined by cost function in phantom (0.86 {\textpm} 0.06 vs. 0.98 {\textpm} 0.02; Student's t-test, P = 0.04) and in subject scans (0.69 {\textpm} 0.06 vs. 0.53 {\textpm} 0.06; Student's t-test, P {\textless} 0.0001). Agreement between manual and unsupervised derived binding ratios as measured by {ICC} was significantly higher on {WR} as compared to {UWR} images (0.91 vs. 0.76). Motor {UPDRS} score was significantly correlated with manual and unsupervised derived binding potential. In phantom, as well as in subjects studies, correlations were more significant using the {WR} method ({BPm:} R2 = 0.36, P = 0.0001; {BPwr:} R2 = 0.368, P = 0.0001; {BPuwr:} R2 = 0.300, P = 0.0008). Weighted registration improves accuracy of binding potential estimates and may be a promising approach to enhance the diagnostic outcome of {SPECT} imaging, correlation with disease severity, and for monitoring disease progression in Parkinsonian syndromes.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES:} The main neuropathological feature in Parkinson's disease is a severe degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra resulting in a loss of dopamine ({DA)} transporters in the striatum. [{123I]beta-CIT} single photon emission computed tomography ({SPECT)} studies have demonstrated this loss of striatal {DA} transporter content in Parkinson's disease in vivo. However, studies with this radioligand also showed that an adequate imaging of the striatal {DA} transporter content could only be performed on the day after the injection of radioligand, which is not convenient for outpatient evaluations. Recently, a new radioligand [{123I]FP-CIT}, with faster kinetics than beta-{CIT}, became available for imaging of the {DA} transporter with {SPECT}, and the applicability of this ligand was tested in patients with early and advanced Parkinson's disease, using a one day protocol. {METHODS:} [{123I]FP-CIT} {SPECT} was performed in six patients with early and 12 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, and in six age matched healthy volunteers. {RESULTS:} Compared with an age matched control group striatal [{123I]FP-CIT} uptake in patients with Parkinson's disease was decreased, and this result was measurable three hours after injection of the radioligand. In the Parkinson's disease group the uptake in the putamen was reduced more than in the caudate nucleus. The contralateral striatal uptake of [{123I]FP-CIT} was significantly lower than the ipsilateral striatal uptake in the Parkinson's disease group. Specific to non-specific striatal uptake ratios correlated with the Hoehn and Yahr stage. A subgroup of patients with early Parkinson's disease also showed significantly lower uptake in the putamen and lower putamen:caudate ratios than controls. {CONCLUSION:} [{123I]FP-CIT} {SPECT} allows a significant discrimination between patients with Parkinson's disease and age matched controls with a one day protocol, which will be to great advantage in outpatient evaluations.},
