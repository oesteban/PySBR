In this work, technetium-99methylcysteinatedimer ({99mTc-ECD)} {SPECT} data sets of 28 {AD} patients and 28 asymptomatic controls were used for the analysis. For a series of different data preprocessing methods, which includes methods for spatial normalization, smoothing, and intensity normalization, multivariate image analysis based on principal component analysis ({PCA)} and Fisher discriminant analysis ({FDA)} was applied. Bootstrap resampling was used to investigate the robustness of the analysis and the classification accuracy, depending on the data preprocessing method. Depending on the combination of preprocessing methods, significant differences regarding the classification accuracy were observed. For {99mTc-ECD} {SPECT} data, the optimal data preprocessing method in terms of robustness and classification accuracy is based on affine registration, smoothing with a Gaussian of 12 mm full width half maximum, and intensity normalization based on the 25\% brightest voxels within the whole-brain region.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} To design a novel algorithm ({BasGan)} for automatic segmentation of striatal ({123)I-FP-CIT} {SPECT.}
{METHODS:} The {BasGan} algorithm is based on a high-definition, three-dimensional ({3D)} striatal template, derived from Talairach's atlas. A blurred template, obtained by convolving the former with a {3D} Gaussian kernel ({FWHM} = 10 mm), approximates striatal activity distribution. The algorithm performs translations and scale transformation on the bicommissural aligned image to set the striatal templates with standard size in an appropriate initial position. An optimization protocol automatically performs fine adjustments in the positioning of blurred templates to best match the radioactive counts, and locates an occipital {ROI} for background evaluation. Partial volume effect correction is included in the process of uptake computation of caudate, putamen and background. Experimental validation was carried out by means of six acquisitions of an anthropomorphic striatal phantom. The {BasGan} software was applied to a first set of patients with Parkinson's disease ({PD)} versus patients affected by essential tremor.
{RESULTS:} A highly significant correlation was achieved between true binding potential and measured ({123)I} activity from the phantom. ({123)I-FP-CIT} uptake was significantly lower in all basal ganglia in the {PD} group versus controls with both {BasGan} and a conventional {ROI} method used for comparison, but particularly with the former. Correlations with the motor {UPDRS} score were far more significant with the {BasGan.}
{CONCLUSION:} The novel {BasGan} algorithm automatically performs the {3D} segmentation of striata. Because co-registered {MRI} is not needed, it can be used by all nuclear medicine departments, since it is freely available on the Web.},

	abstract = {Automatic segmentation of subcortical structures in human brain {MR} images is an important but difficult task due to poor and variable intensity contrast. Clear, well-defined intensity features are absent in many places along typical structure boundaries and so extra information is required to achieve successful segmentation. A method is proposed here that uses manually labelled image data to provide anatomical training information. It utilises the principles of the Active Shape and Appearance Models but places them within a Bayesian framework, allowing probabilistic relationships between shape and intensity to be fully exploited. The model is trained for 15 different subcortical structures using 336 manually-labelled T1-weighted {MR} images. Using the Bayesian approach, conditional probabilities can be calculated easily and efficiently, avoiding technical problems of ill-conditioned covariance matrices, even with weak priors, and eliminating the need for fitting extra empirical scaling parameters, as is required in standard Active Appearance Models. Furthermore, differences in boundary vertex locations provide a direct, purely local measure of geometric change in structure between groups that, unlike voxel-based morphometry, is not dependent on tissue classification methods or arbitrary smoothing. In this paper the fully-automated segmentation method is presented and assessed both quantitatively, using Leave-One-Out testing on the 336 training images, and qualitatively, using an independent clinical dataset involving Alzheimer's disease. Median Dice overlaps between 0.7 and 0.9 are obtained with this method, which is comparable or better than other automated methods. An implementation of this method, called {FIRST}, is currently distributed with the freely-available {FSL} package.},

These algorithms require accurate modelling of the so-called point spread function ({PSF).} Nowadays, most in vivo neurotransmitter {SPECT} studies employ pharmaceuticals radiolabelled with {123I.} In addition to an intense line at 159 {keV}, the decay scheme of this radioisotope includes some higher energy gammas which may have a non-negligible contribution to the {PSF.} The aim of this work is to study this contribution for two low-energy high-resolution collimator configurations, namely, the parallel and the fan beam. The transport of radiation through the material system is simulated with the Monte Carlo code {PENELOPE.} We have developed a main program that deals with the intricacies associated with tracking photon trajectories through the geometry of the collimator and detection systems. The simulated {PSFs} are partly validated with a set of experimental measurements that use the 511 {keV} annihilation photons emitted by a {18F} source. Sensitivity and spatial resolution have been studied, showing that a significant fraction of the detection events in the energy window centred at 159 {keV} (up to approximately 49\% for the parallel collimator) are originated by higher energy gamma rays, which contribute to the spatial profile of the {PSF} mostly outside the 'geometrical' region dominated by the low-energy photons. Therefore, these high-energy counts are to be considered as noise, a fact that should be taken into account when modelling {PSFs} for reconstruction algorithms. We also show that the fan beam collimator gives higher signal-to-noise ratios than the parallel collimator for all the source positions analysed.},

	abstract = {{123I} is a commonly used radioisotope employed in neurotransmitter {SPECT} studies. In addition to an intense line at 159 {keV}, the decay scheme of this radioisotope includes a low yield (\~{}3\%) of higher energy photons which make a non-negligible contribution to the final image when low-energy high-resolution ({LEHR)} collimators are used. This contribution of high-energy photons may reach \~{}28\% of the total counts in the projections. The aim of this work is to model each energy component of the high-energy Point Spread Function ({hPSF)} for fan-beam {LEHR} collimators in order to develop fast Monte Carlo ({MC)} simulations of high-energy ray contamination. The modeling of {hPSF} was based on the results of simulating photons through the collimator-detector system using the {MC} code {PENELOPE.} Since low-energy {PSFs} models for fan-beam collimators tend to a Gaussian distribution, we use the same function for the {hPSF} modeling for high-energy photons. The parameters of these Gaussian functions (g(x,y)) were obtained by minimizing the root mean square error ({RMS)} using the sensitivity of the simulated {hPSFs} as a constraint. The {hPSFs} were parameterized for a range of energies between 350 {keV} and 538 {keV.} The {RMS} attained after fitting of g(x,y) to the simulated {hPSFs} was always smaller than \~{}2\% of the mean sensitivity per pixel of the image. A strong dependence of the sensitivity on the type and thickness of the backscatter material behind the crystal was found. Our results indicate that Gaussian distributions approximate the {hPSF} responses for fan-beam collimators.

The aim of this work was to compare the quantitative capabilities of two different {SPECT} systems through Monte Carlo ({MC)} simulation. The {SimSET} {MC} code was employed to generate simulated projections of a numerical phantom for two gamma cameras equipped with a parallel and a fan-beam collimator, respectively. A fully {3D} iterative reconstruction algorithm was used to compensate for attenuation, the spatially variant point spread function ({PSF)} and scatter. A post-reconstruction partial volume effect ({PVE)} compensation was also developed. For both systems, the correction for all degradations and {PVE} compensation resulted in recovery factors of the theoretical specific uptake ratio ({SUR)} close to 100\%. For a {SUR} value of 4, the recovered {SUR} for the parallel imaging system was 33\% for a reconstruction without corrections ({OSEM)}, 45\% for a reconstruction with attenuation correction ({OSEM-A)}, 56\% for a {3D} reconstruction with attenuation and {PSF} corrections ({OSEM-AP)}, 68\% for {OSEM-AP} with scatter correction ({OSEM-APS)} and 97\% for {OSEM-APS} plus {PVE} compensation ({OSEM-APSV).} For the fan-beam imaging system, the recovered {SUR} was 41\% without corrections, 55\% for {OSEM-A}, 65\% for {OSEM-AP}, 75\% for {OSEM-APS} and 102\% for {OSEM-APSV.} Our findings indicate that the correction for degradations increases the quantification accuracy, with {PVE} compensation playing a major role in the {SUR} quantification. The proposed methodology allows us to reach similar {SUR} values for different {SPECT} systems, thereby allowing a reliable standardisation in multicentric studies.},

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the modern world. Cardiac imaging is routinely applied for assessment and diagnosis of cardiac diseases. Computerized image analysis methods are now widely applied to cardiac segmentation and registration in order to extract the anatomy and contractile function of the heart. The vast number of recent papers on this topic point to the need for an up to date survey in order to summarize and classify the published literature. This paper presents a survey of shape modeling applications to cardiac image analysis from {MRI}, {CT}, echocardiography, {PET}, and {SPECT} and aims to (1) introduce new methodologies in this field, (2) classify major contributions in image-based cardiac modeling, (3) provide a tutorial to beginners to initiate their own studies, and (4) introduce the major challenges of registration and segmentation and provide practical examples. The techniques surveyed include statistical models, deformable models/level sets, biophysical models, and non-rigid registration using basis functions. About 130 journal articles are categorized based on methodology, output, imaging system, modality, and validations. The advantages and disadvantages of the registration and validation techniques are discussed as appropriate in each section.},

	abstract = {{GIMIAS} is a workflow-oriented environment for addressing advanced biomedical image computing and build personalized computational models, which is extensible through the development of application-specific plug-ins. In addition, {GIMIAS} provides an open source framework for efficient development of research and clinical software prototypes integrating contributions from the Virtual Physiological Human community while allowing business-friendly technology transfer and commercial product development. This framework has been fully developed in {ANSI-C++} on top of well known open source libraries like {VTK}, {ITK} and {wxWidgets} among others. Based on {GIMIAS}, in this paper is presented a workflow for medical image analysis and simulation of the heart.},

	abstract = {One of the most challenging problems in modern neuroimaging is detailed characterization of neurodegeneration. Quantifying spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia ({FTD)} and Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease ({AD)}, which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method ({SyN)} for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the {Euler{\textendash}Lagrange} equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast {SyN{\textquoteright}s} performance with a related elastic method and with the standard {ITK} implementation of Thirion{\textquoteright}s Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of {FTD} and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, {SyN{\textquoteright}s} volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that {SyN}, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric {MRI} of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present an efficient three-dimensional (3-D) parallel thinning algorithm for extracting both the medial surfaces and the medial axes of a 3-D object (given as a 3-D binary image). A new Euler table is derived to ensure the invariance of the Euler characteristic of the object, during thinning. An octree data structure of 3 {\texttimes} 3 {\texttimes} 3 lattice points is built to examine the local connectivity. The sets of "simple" points found by different researchers are compared with the constructed set. Different definitions of "surface" points including ours are given. By preserving the topological and the geometrical conditions, our algorithm produces desirable skeletons and performs better than others in terms of noise sensitivity and speed. Pre- and postprocessors can be used to remove additional noise spurs. Its use in defect analysis of objects produced by casting and forging is discussed.},
